
Some of the data files in this directory need to have gpp
run on them with certain options. They are the following:

data2	- gpp needs to be run with -X and -Y	(log10 scaling)

data3	- gpp needs to be run with -l		(least squares fit)

data4	- gpp needs to be run with -P		(Power equation fit)

data5	- gpp needs to be run with -G		(Saturated growth fit)

data1 doesn't particulary need anything, but demos some of the
intricacies of the input language.
