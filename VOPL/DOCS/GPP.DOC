DESCRIPTION
     This program displays multiple  graphs  with  various  curve
     fitting  and axis options.  The following options are avail-
     able:


     -l<d>
          Perform a least square fit of degree "d" on each curve.


     -s <s1> <s2>
          Perform a cubic spline fit  on  each  curve,  with  end
          slopes s1 and s2 (Ie. a clamped spline)


     -r <fact>
          Reduce (if fact < 1.0) or enlarge (if fact >  1.0)  the
          entire plot.


     -S   Perform a cubic spline fit on each curve using a cardi-
          nal  spline  and the VOGLE(3) routine curve().  The end
          slopes are calculated  as  the  tangent  to  the  curve
          formed  by  the  lines  connecting the first and second
          points and the last and next to last points.


     -P   Perform a power equation fit on each curve.


     -G   Perform a saturated growth rate fit on each curve.


     -m<n>
          Place a marker at every "n"th data point on each curve.


     -g<n>
          Place a grid over the graph, with grid spacing of every
          nth tickmark.

     -p<n>
          Draws only markers at every <n>th data point


     -L   Print legends if they are provided.


     -x xmin xmax
          Specify absolute x  scaling  values.  This  option  by-
          passes the auto-scaling of the x-axis values.


     -y ymin ymax
          Specify absolute y  scaling  values.  This  option  by-
          passes the auto-scaling of the y-axis values.


     -X   Draw the X-axis using a logarithmic scale.


     -Y   Draw the Y-axis using a logarithmic scale.


     -f<fontname>
          Use font name  fontname  where  fontname  is  any  font
          available in the VOGLE(3) library.


     -d<device>
          Use the output device "device". These are  the  devices
          compiled  into the VOGLE(3) library. Some examples are:
          postscript, hpgl, tek, sun etc.


     file The name of the input file. If it is a minus '-'  stdin
          is assumed.

     The input file contains two lines at the type which describe
     the  graph.  The  first line gives the title, and the second
     line the type. At the moment  the  only  type  supported  is
     "xy".  The  axes titles appropriate to the type of the graph
     are on the lines following the  type  statement.  After  the
     axes  titles  the first legend title is given followed by an
     axes descriptor on the next line.  gpp then reads in  points
     appropriate  to  the axes descriptor until it reaches a plot
     statement. This tells it to save the  current  points  as  a
     seperate  plot. It then looks for another legend followed by
     an axes statement, and  the  cycle  continues.  Legends  and
     titles may be blank lines.

          A title for the graph
          type xy

BUGS
     There are too many options.  There may be only  1024  points
     per  trace.   Interpretation  of  Endslopes for splines when
     using logarithmic scalings is Sketchy.
