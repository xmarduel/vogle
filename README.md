# vogle graphic library
In the beginnings of 2000 (yes), I used to work with the vogle graphic library **version 2.0b**.
The main improvement over the previous verison (**version 1.3** I believe) was the support for multiple windows.

Nowadays in 2022, after a 20 years pause, I am not able anymore to find in Eric. Echidna page this version 2.0b.
I have lost the tar file, but still have the sources with some minimal improvments made by myself.
Unfortunately I have lost all the examples based on 2.0b (there was for example a "lotsofwindows.c demo).

There is a **winopen** function replacing the **vinit** one, but compatibility is provided.

The **vopl** plotting lib (based on **vogle**) had not yet reached the 2.0 level, so I did it at the time.
I added many things in **vopl** (ex: subpanel handling ala pgplot, countour on ucd mesh etc), so I named
this **version 2.0b** too, and the diff between my version and the official last version is quite large.

If someone still has the tar file of **vogle-2.0b**, please let me know. Thank you in advance.

PS: I put my source in this repo soon
