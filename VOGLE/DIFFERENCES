VOGLE 1.3.0 has the following differences from 1.2.3

There are new Hershey text justification routines.
There is now a facility for general linestyles.
There is now a colour postscript driver (I dunno why there wasn't
always one!).

VOGLE 1.2.3 has the following differences from 1.2.2

You can now specify an X11 toolkit window for vogle to draw into.

VOGLE 1.2.2 has the following differences from 1.2.1

A "syncing" function has been added. On devices such as X11 and NeXT
the display is not automatically Syncronized after each primitive is
drawn, rather it is done after completion of whole sets of primitives.
Eg. patches and objects - a sync is done only after the while thing has
been drawn - not after each draw within the patch or object.

VOGLE 1.2.1 has the following differences from 1.2

There is now a SUN Pascal interface.

VOGLE 1.2 has the following differences from 1.1

Library:
	Speed up the transforms by directly (in place) multipling
	maticies on the top of the stack.

VOGLE 1.1 has the following differences from 1.0:

Drivers:
	These have been extended to incorporate double
	buffering, the X11 driver should now work
	under anything (exception a dec workstation
	use decX11), the sun driver refreshes the window
	if it erased.

Library:
	Routines for doing backfacing, doublebuffering,
	positioning and sizing of windows (where it is allowed),
	getting info about the screen aspect ratio, specifying
	a world up vector, reading in a string of input have
	been added (it is best to look at the manual page for
	these).

Examples:
	There are some new examples demonstrating, position
	calls, backfacing, and doublebuffering.
